Gave smaller rewards for some progress on X
But, found it was preferring to stay in the middle (small reward), than take the risk of going left (no reward) to gain a higher reward for reaching further on the right (high reward)

   if next_state[0] >= -0.5:
                reward += 1
            elif next_state[0] >= 0.0:
                reward += 5
            elif next_state[0] >= 0.1:
                reward += 10
            elif next_state[0] >= 0.25:
                reward += 20
            elif next_state[0] >= 0.5:
                reward += 100
